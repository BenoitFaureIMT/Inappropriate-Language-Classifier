\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The goal of the project}
Define and tackle the problem as a ML problem

\subsection{What is Inappropriate Language?}

\subsection{Extension}

\pagebreak
\section{Benchmarking}
Define the methodology and the protocol of the experiment\\
Also describe shortly how we did it

\subsection{Dataset}

\subsubsection{Details}

Here we have to detail the columns, maybe give some examples.\\But most importantly: Describe and analyse the data!

\subsubsection{Concerns?}
We have to mention the data is from social media -> that's not what we want, etc etc

\subsubsection{Sources}

And how we merged them.

\subsection{Models}

\subsubsection{Preamble}
We have to make a short review of NLP and explain shortly how ML and DL deal with text (tokenizer, embedder).\\Then we'll add that we also used pretrained embedders - GLoVE. 

\subsubsection{Decision Tree}

\subsubsection{Random Forest}

\subsubsection{Support Vector Classifier}

\subsubsection{Long Short Term Mermory (LSTM)}

\subsubsection{Transformers (DistilBERT)?}

\subsection{Metrics}
Which metrics did we use?

\pagebreak
\section{Results}
Make tables with all models and metrics.\\
Add also how it performed with "new data"

\pagebreak
\section{Final Model}
Motivate the selection of your final solution.\\
Deliver that solution in the form of a predictive model that can be used on new input
data.
